# Muhammad Shaheem — Aspiring SOC Analyst

Cybersecurity student focused on **defensive security, SOC workflows, alert triage, and log-centric analysis**. I build tools and run controlled labs to understand how real threats are **detected, investigated, and handled** from logs to response.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔐 [password-manager-xor-cpp](https://github.com/Shaheem22/password-manager-xor-cpp)  
**CLI Password Manager with XOR Encryption (C++)**  

A command-line tool that stores and retrieves credentials from an encrypted vault using XOR.  
- Menu-driven CLI for credential management  
- Vault encryption/decryption with a user-provided key  
- Practical file I/O and basic crypto concepts  
> XOR is used for learning purposes, not production security.

### 📦 [file-huffman-xor-tool](https://github.com/Shaheem22/file-huffman-xor-tool)  
**File Compression + XOR Encryption Tool (C++)**  

Combines **Huffman coding** for compression with XOR-based encryption.  
- Huffman tree construction and encoding/decoding  
- Integrated encryption stage with user key  
- Focus on algorithms, data structures, and binary processing

### 📱 [ceh-module17-mobile-labs](https://github.com/Shaheem22/ceh-module17-mobile-labs)  
**CEH Module 17 — Mobile Hacking Labs**  

Hands-on, documented labs using ParrotOS and an Android emulator.  
- Controlled lab setups and execution  
- Tool usage (Phonesploit, SET) with evidence  
- Step-by-step documentation of outcomes
